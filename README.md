# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Azell Aneya's Prework Study Guide>

## Description
This study guide was started as part of a pre-program requirement to begin the foundation of learning for computer programming, containing notes on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. I built this project for that same reason, to begin the foundation for learning and honing a special skill. Computer programming is a avenue that will never be in need of people. People are the most important component for a computer to function and all of it's various uses. This study guide can help anyone who is beginning the same journey I am, and gives them (and myself) a place to come back to and rely on for information and security. Anyone who needs a place to come back to for a quick refresh or to study for an upcoming exam can rely on my guide. I myself have already learned so much about the various tools used to make a simple site, and the work that it requires. Guarenteeed I did it alone, but it's rewarding to see something made completely from scratch and come out so cool! I hope anyone who looks at my site enjoys the information and pretty looks!

Navigate to a programming language, there are four. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Read below the headings for notes on commands, purposes and definitions. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
